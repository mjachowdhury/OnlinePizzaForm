# OnlinePizzaForm
 Build a web site that accepts customer order details for a fully customisable product (e.g. t-shirt or pizza etc but NOT a MUG) and successfully sends all the required data to the specified PHP server http://atlantis.cit.ie/displayvalues.php.  Note: If the form is submitted correctly you should be able to see the variables listed on the php webpage listed above.  No data should be sent to the server until all the required input has been entered and validated
